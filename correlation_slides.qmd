## Correlation vs t-test

In statistics, there are tests for __differences__; and tests for __association__

* t-test is for __difference__ between groups
  * are women better than men at volleyball?
* correlation is for __association__ between variables
  * is more practice associated with better performance?

---

### t-test

Women are better than men at volleyball.

```{r}
volleyball = sleep %>% 
  mutate(
    `volleyball skill` = sqrt(extra^2),
    Gender = factor(group, levels=c(1,2), labels=c("Men", "Women"))
    )
ggplot(volleyball, aes(y=`volleyball skill`, x=Gender, fill=Gender))+
  stat_summary(fun=mean, position=position_dodge(width=0.95), geom="bar")+
  theme_apa()+
  theme(axis.title.y = element_text(angle = 0, hjust = 0.5, vjust=0.5))+
  scale_fill_discrete(guide = "none")
  
```

---

### correlation

More practice is generally associated with better performance (with exceptions)

```{r 'example plot', cache=TRUE}
prac = read_excel("practice_vs_performance.xlsx") 
prac2=prac
prac2$practice=prac2$practice+runif(10,-1.5,1.5)
prac2$performance[1] = 7.5
prac2$practice[1] = 0.5
prac2$performance[8] = 0.5
prac = prac %>% bind_rows(prac2)
ggplot(prac, aes(x=practice, y=performance))+
  theme_apa()+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(se=F, method = 'lm')+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=0:10, limits=c(0,10)) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks=0:10, limits=c(0,10)) +
  theme(axis.title.y = element_text(angle = 0, hjust = 0.5, vjust=0.5))+
  theme(axis.title.x = element_text(size = 20), axis.title.y = element_text(size = 20))
```

---

### Understand what you are comparing

1. Time living in East Asia (__practice__)
2. Ability to recognise Asian Chinese faces (__performance__)

```{r}
ggplot(data=tibble(PRACTICE=0:10, PERFORMANCE=0:10), aes(PRACTICE, PERFORMANCE))+
  scale_x_continuous(labels = NULL, breaks = NULL)+
  scale_y_continuous(labels = NULL, breaks = NULL)+
  theme_apa()+theme(axis.title.y = element_text(angle = 0, hjust = 0.5, vjust=0.5))+
  labs(x = "PRACTICE\n(duration_SEA)")+
  labs(y = "PERFORMANCE\n(accuracy_Asian)")+
  theme(axis.title.x = element_text(size = 20), axis.title.y = element_text(size = 20))
```

What relationship do we expect between practice and performance? -- in general

```{r}
ggplot(data=tibble(PRACTICE=0:10, PERFORMANCE=0:10), aes(PRACTICE, PERFORMANCE))+
  scale_x_continuous(labels = NULL, breaks = NULL)+
  scale_y_continuous(labels = NULL, breaks = NULL)+
  theme_apa()+theme(axis.title.y = element_text(angle = 0, hjust = 0.5, vjust=0.5))+
  #labs(x = "PRACTICE\n(duration_SEA)")+
  #labs(y = "PERFORMANCE\n(accuracy_Asian)")+
  theme(axis.title.x = element_text(size = 20), axis.title.y = element_text(size = 20))

  scale_y_continuous(limits=c(minperf, maxperf), breaks=seq(25, 100, 25))+

What do the raw data say?

```{r}
ggplot(dummy_data, aes(y=accuracy_Asian, x=duration_SEA))+
  theme_apa()+theme(axis.title.y = element_text(angle = 0, hjust = 0.5, vjust=0.5))+

  theme(axis.title.x = element_text(size = 20), axis.title.y = element_text(size = 20))
```



## Common-sense summary so far

* More practice usually means better performance
* More time spent in East Asia gives a person more practice at recognising Asian Chinese faces
* As Caucasians spend more and more time living in East Asia, they get better and better at recognising Asian Chinese faces

## Correlation 

* Running a correlation tells you how consistent the relationship is between practice and performance, across a group. 
1. As a person's practice score deviates from the group average practice, does their performance score deviate from the group average performance score ___in the same direction?___
2. As a person's practice score deviates from the group average practice, does their performance score deviate from the group average performance score ___by the same amount?___

## Two types of difference

1. Difference in direction, + or -
    * Differences of __direction__ tell us whether performance goes up or down with practice, and are reflected in the sign of the r value, positive or negative, plus or minus.
2. Difference of amount, between 0 and 1
    * Differences of __amount__ tell us whether practice is strongly related to performance or only weakly, or not related at all, 0 for not related at all, 1 for perfectly related. Two perfectly related variables change together at a fixed rate.

---

* So, r can be anywhere from -1 to 1.
  * 1: as people practice more, their performance goes up more, and the increased practice carries on being associated with better performance as practice goes up more and more, by the same amount. Each additional hour of practice is associated with a performance boost of the same size for each hour of practice.
  
---

* So, r can be anywhere from -1 to 1.
  * 0: when practice goes up, performance can go up, but it can also go down: performance isn't related to practice at all.
  
---

* So, r can be anywhere from -1 to 1.
  * -1 (notice the minus sign) : when practice goes up, performance goes __down__, and it keeps on going down the more practice you do: each additional hour of practice is associated with an additional decrease in performance of the same size for each additional hour of practice.

## Example, r of 0.3

* If r is 0.3 then each additional hour of practice would be associated with a performance boost, because 0.3 is positive. However, the boost would be quite variable, because 0.3 is quite a lot smaller than 1 (r of 1 would represent a constant increase in performance for each hour of practice). Some hours of practice would probably be associated with ___reduced___ performance because 0.3 is so close to 0, meaning that the boost is very variable.

## The role of p

p tells us something about the population based on what we see in the sample.

Good p values (less than 0.05) mean that whatever we found in the sample is probably true of the wider population. If we found that r was 0.7 in our sample, and p was 0.04, we could say that just as performance increased without much variability (r is positive 0.7) for each hour of practice in our participants, it probably (p less than 0.05) increases without much variability for people in general.

### Correlation in JASP

<!-- [switch to screen-sharing demo] -->

First we need to test the assumption of normality because the result of that test tells us whether to do Pearson's r or Spearman's rho.

If p <.05 then the assumption of normality is violated. If it is not violated then use Pearson's r. If it is violated use Spearman's rho.

How to test for normality in JASP. _Bear in mind that you will get different values because I'm using dummy data_.

![](Screenshot_assumption_check.png){width=100%} 

---

In our dummy data, $p$ was 0.026 which is less than 0.05 so the assumption of normality was violated. Therefore we use Spearman's rho for the correlation test.

JASP output for correlation test

![](Screenshot_correlation_table.png)

<!-- [red]{style="color:blue"} -->

A [Spearman's]{style="color:blue"} correlation was conducted in JASP [version 0.19.3]{style="color:blue"} to examine the relationship between time spent living in South-East Asia and recognition accuracy for Asian faces. The results indicated a [significant positive]{style="color:blue"} relationship, rs(48) = [.606]{style="color:blue"}, p < [.001]{style="color:blue"}.
